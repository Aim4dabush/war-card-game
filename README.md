## Overview

We were assigned to create any game. I've always played this game has a kid and I really haven't come across a game like war so I thought it would be a great game to design.

### Goals

- Create any game
- Have a way to keep score
- Have a win/lose condition
- Have a notification of a win/lose condition
- Have the ability to reset the game and points

### What I Learned

I learned a lot about the logic of creating a game. I used a lot of css `animation`, `transform`, and `transition` to create a more eye pleasing game. I had difficulty at first because I was trying to use the api to do the logic of the game but once I scrapped it and used my own javascript logic it was a breeze.
